# Reddit Post Updates (WIP)
A reddit scraper that retrieves every new post in a given subreddit and delivers them to the user in whatever form specified.
# Use
Created initially for r/photomarket, as I noticed that many of the good deals that users would post were gone far before I was able to see them. The initial goal for this script is to send me an email whenever a "sell" post is listed.

# Future Additions
- Refine filtering system
- Add notification delivery service
- More scraping functionalities
